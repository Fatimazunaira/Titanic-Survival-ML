#  Titanic Survival Prediction â€” Machine Learning Project

A predictive modeling project using the Titanic dataset to analyze passenger survival and build a logistic regression model.

---

##  Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset through visual analysis and builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. It focuses on binary classification using logistic regression and evaluates model performance with multiple metrics.

---

##  Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize survival patterns based on gender, class, and age
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

##  Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 3rd class
- Younger passengers (especially children) had higher survival probability
- Final model achieved an **accuracy of ~80.7%**

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (model building and evaluation)

---

##  Files Included
